lprint("- Barry!")
lprint("A puddle jump for us,")

lprint("- No, you go.")
lprint("Oh, my. What's available?")
lprint("Restroom attendant's open,")
lprint("not for the reason you think.")
lprint("- Any chance of getting the Krelman?")
lprint("- Sure, you're on.")
lprint("I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.")
lprint("Wax monkey's always open.")
lprint("The Krelman opened up again.")
lprint("What happened?")
lprint("A bee died. Makes an opening. See?")
lprint("He's dead. Another dead one.")
lprint("Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.")
lprint("Dead from the neck up.")

lprint("Stand to the side, kid.")
lprint("It's got a bit of a kick.")
lprint("That is one nectar collector!")
lprint("- Ever see pollination up close?")
lprint("- No, sir.")
lprint("I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it")
lprint("over here. Maybe a dash over there,")
lprint("a pinch on that one.")
lprint("See that? It's a little bit of magic.")
lprint("That's amazing. Why do we do that?")
lprint("That's pollen power. More pollen, more")

lprint("Oool.")
lprint("I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.")

lprint("Not like a flower, but I like it.")
lprint("Yeah, fuzzy.")

lprint("What is this?!")
lprint("Match point!")

lprint("He blinked!")
lprint("Spray him, Granny!")
lprint("What are you doing?!")
lprint("Wow... the tension level")
lprint("out here is unbelievable.")

lprint("Ken, could you close")
lprint("the window please?")
lprint("Oheck out my new resume.")
lprint("I made it into a fold-out brochure.")

lprint("Don't kill him!")
lprint("You know I'm allergic to them!")
lprint("This thing could kill me!")
lprint("Why does his life have")

lprint("My brochure!")
lprint("There you go, little guy.")
lprint("I'm not scared of him.")
lprint("It's an allergic thing.")
lprint("Put that on your resume brochure.")
lprint("My whole face could puff up.")
lprint("Make it one of your special skills.")
lprint("Knocking someone out")

lprint("- Bye.")
lprint("I gotta say something.")
lprint("She saved my life.")
lprint("I gotta say something.")
lprint("All right, here it goes.")
lprint("Nah.")
lprint("What would I say?")
lprint("I could really get in trouble.")
lprint("It's a bee law.")
lprint("You're not supposed to talk to a human.")
lprint("I can't believe I'm doing this.")
lprint("I've got to.")
lprint("Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!")
lprint("No. Yes. No.")

lprint("No, it's OK. It's fine.")
lprint("I know I'm dreaming.")
lprint("But I don't recall going to bed.")
lprint("Well, I'm sure this")
lprint("is very disconcerting.")
lprint("This is a bit of a surprise to me.")
lprint("I mean, you're a bee!")
lprint("I am. And I'm not supposed")
lprint("to be doing this,")
lprint("but they were all trying to kill me.")
lprint("And if it wasn't for you...")
lprint("I had to thank you.")
lprint("It's just how I was raised.")
lprint("That was a little weird.")
lprint("- I'm talking with a bee.")
lprint("- Yeah.")
lprint("I'm talking to a bee.")
lprint("And the bee is talking to me!")
lprint("I just want to say I'm grateful.")
lprint("I'll leave now.")
lprint("- Wait! How did you learn to do that?")
lprint("- What?")
lprint("The talking thing.")
lprint("Same way you did, I guess.")
lprint("Mama, Dada, honey.' You pick it up.")
lprint("- That's very funny.")
lprint("- Yeah.")
lprint("Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,")
lprint("we'd cry with what we have to deal with.")
lprint("Anyway...")
lprint("Oan I...")
lprint("...get you something?")
lprint("- Like what?")
lprint("I don't know. I mean...")
lprint("I don't know. Ooffee?")
lprint("I don't want to put you out.")
lprint("It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.")
lprint("- It's just coffee.")
lprint("- I hate to impose.")
lprint("- Don't be ridiculous!")
lprint("- Actually, I would love a cup.")
lprint("Hey, you want rum cake?")
lprint("- I shouldn't.")
lprint("- Have some.")
lprint("- No, I can't.")
lprint("- Oome on!")
lprint("I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.")
lprint("- Where?")
lprint("- These stripes don't help.")
lprint("You look great!")

lprint("anything about fashion.")
lprint("Are you all right?")
lprint("No.")
lprint("He's making the tie in the cab")

lprint("I thought you said Guatemalan.")
lprint("'Why would I marry a watermelon?'")
lprint("Is that a bee joke?")
lprint("That's the kind of stuff we do.")
lprint("Yeah, different.")
lprint("So, what are you gonna do, Barry?")
lprint("About work? I don't know.")
lprint("I want to do my part for the hive,")
lprint("but I can't do it the way they want.")
lprint("I know how you feel.")
lprint("- You do?")
lprint("- Sure.")
lprint("My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or")
lprint("a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.")
lprint("- Really?")
lprint("- My only interest is flowers.")
lprint("Our new queen was just elected")
lprint("with that same campaign slogan.")
lprint("Anyway, if you look...")
lprint("There's my hive right there. See it?")
lprint("You're in Sheep Meadow!")
lprint("Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!")
lprint("No way! I know that area.")
lprint("I lost a toe ring there once.")
lprint("- Why do girls put rings on their toes?")
lprint("- Why not?")
lprint("- It's like putting a hat on your knee.")
lprint("- Maybe I'll try that.")
lprint("- You all right, ma'am?")
lprint("- Oh, yeah. Fine.")
lprint("Just having two cups of coffee!")
lprint("Anyway, this has been great.")
lprint("Thanks for the coffee.")
lprint("Yeah, it's no trouble.")
lprint("Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,")
lprint("I'd be up the rest of my life.")
lprint("Are you...?")
lprint("Oan I take a piece of this with me?")
lprint("Sure! Here, have a crumb.")
lprint("- Thanks!")
lprint("- Yeah.")
lprint("All right. Well, then...")
lprint("I guess I'll see you around.")
lprint("Or not.")
lprint("OK, Barry.")
lprint("And thank you")
lprint("so much again... for before.")
lprint("Oh, that? That was nothing.")
lprint("Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...")
lprint("This can't possibly work.")
lprint("He's all set to go.")
lprint("We may as well try it.")
lprint("OK, Dave, pull the chute.")
lprint("- Sounds amazing.")
lprint("- It was amazing!")
lprint("It was the scariest,")
lprint("happiest moment of my life.")
lprint("Humans! I can't believe")
lprint("you were with humans!")
lprint("Giant, scary humans!")
lprint("What were they like?")
lprint("Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.")
lprint("They eat crazy giant things.")
lprint("They drive crazy.")

lprint("- Well...")
lprint("- Well?")
lprint("Well, I met someone.")
lprint("You did? Was she Bee-ish?")
lprint("- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!")
lprint("- No, no, no, not a wasp.")
lprint("- Spider?")
lprint("- I'm not attracted to spiders.")
lprint("I know it's the hottest thing,")
lprint("with the eight legs and all.")
lprint("I can't get by that face.")
lprint("So who is she?")
lprint("She's... human.")
lprint("No, no. That's a bee law.")
lprint("You wouldn't break a bee law.")
lprint("- Her name's Vanessa.")
lprint("- Oh, boy.")
lprint("She's so nice. And she's a florist!")
lprint("Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!")
lprint("We're not dating.")
lprint("You're flying outside the hive, talking")
lprint("to humans that attack our homes")
lprint("with power washers and M-8!")
lprint("One-eighth a stick of dynamite!")
lprint("She saved my life!")
lprint("And she understands me.")
lprint("This is over!")
lprint("Eat this.")
lprint("This is not over! What was that?")
lprint("- They call it a crumb.")
lprint("- It was so stingin' stripey!")
lprint("And that's not what they eat.")
lprint("That's what falls off what they eat!")
lprint("- You know what a Oinnabon is?")
lprint("- No.")
lprint("It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.")
lprint("They heat it up...")

lprint("Thinking bee! Thinking bee!")
lprint("There he is. He's in the pool.")
lprint("You know what your problem is, Barry?")
lprint("I gotta start thinking bee?")
lprint("How much longer will this go on?")
lprint("It's been three days!")
lprint("Why aren't you working?")
lprint("I've got a lot of big life decisions")
lprint("to think about.")
lprint("What life? You have no life!")
lprint("You have no job. You're barely a bee!")
lprint("Would it kill you")
lprint("to make a little honey?")
lprint("Barry, come out.")
lprint("Your father's talking to you.")
lprint("Martin, would you talk to him?")
lprint("Barry, I'm talking to you!")
lprint("You coming?")
lprint("Got everything?")

lprint("- I told you not to yell at him.")

lprint("Yeah, OK, I see, I see.")
lprint("All right, your turn.")
lprint("TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?")
lprint("That's insane!")
lprint("You don't have that?")
lprint("We have Hivo, but it's a disease.")
lprint("It's a horrible, horrible disease.")
lprint("Oh, my.")
lprint("Dumb bees!")
lprint("You must want to sting all those jerks.")
lprint("We try not to sting.")
lprint("It's usually fatal for us.")

lprint("- How do you get it?")
lprint("- Bees make it.")
lprint("- I know who makes it!")
lprint("And it's hard to make it!")
lprint("There's heating, cooling, stirring.")
lprint("You need a whole Krelman thing!")
lprint("- It's organic.")
lprint("- It's our-ganic!")
lprint("It's just honey, Barry.")
lprint("Just what?!")
lprint("Bees don't know about this!")
lprint("This is stealing! A lot of stealing!")
lprint("You've taken our homes, schools,")

lprint("Like tiny screaming.")
lprint("Turn off the radio.")
lprint("Whassup, bee boy?")
lprint("Hey, Blood.")
lprint("Just a row of honey jars,")
lprint("as far as the eye could see.")
lprint("Wow!")
lprint("I assume wherever this truck goes")

lprint("I mean, that honey's ours.")
lprint("- Bees hang tight.")
lprint("- We're all jammed in.")
lprint("It's a close community.")
lprint("Not us, man. We on our own.")
lprint("Every mosquito on his own.")
lprint("- What if you get in trouble?")
lprint("- You a mosquito, you in trouble.")
lprint("Nobody likes us. They just smack.")

lprint("Yeah. It doesn't last too long.")
lprint("Do you know you're")

lprint("Honey's pretty important to me.")
lprint("It's important to all bees.")
lprint("We invented it!")

lprint("you'll see how, by taking our honey,")
lprint("you not only take everything we have")

lprint("I wish he'd dress like that")
lprint("all the time. So nice!")
lprint("Oall your first witness.")
lprint("So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden")

lprint("I suppose so.")
lprint("I see you also own")
lprint("Honeyburton and Honron!")
lprint("Yes, they provide beekeepers")

lprint("Beekeeper. I find that")
lprint("to be a very disturbing term.")
lprint("I don't imagine you employ")
lprint("any bee-free-ers, do you?")
lprint("- No.")
lprint("- I couldn't hear you.")
lprint("- No.")
lprint("- No.")
lprint("Because you don't free bees.")
lprint("You keep bees. Not only that,")
lprint("it seems you thought a bear would be")
lprint("an appropriate image for a jar of honey.")
lprint("They're very lovable creatures.")
lprint("Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.")

lprint("OK, that's enough. Take him away.")
lprint("So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.")
lprint("Your name intrigues me.")
lprint("- Where have I heard it before?")
lprint("- I was with a band called The Police.")
lprint("But you've never been")
lprint("a police officer, have you?")
lprint("No, I haven't.")
lprint("No, you haven't. And so here")
lprint("we have yet another example")
lprint("of bee culture casually")
lprint("stolen by a human")
lprint("for nothing more than")
lprint("a prance-about stage name.")
lprint("Oh, please.")
lprint("Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?")
lprint("Because I'm feeling")
lprint("a little stung, Sting.")
lprint("Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!")
lprint("That's not his real name?! You idiots!")
lprint("Mr. Liotta, first,")
lprint("belated congratulations on")
lprint("your Emmy win for a guest spot")
lprint("on ER in 2 5.")
lprint("Thank you. Thank you.")
lprint("I see from your resume")
lprint("that you're devilishly handsome")
lprint("with a churning inner turmoil")
lprint("that's ready to blow.")
lprint("I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?")
lprint("Not yet it isn't. But is this")
lprint("what it's come to for you?")
lprint("Exploiting tiny, helpless bees")
lprint("so you don't")
lprint("have to rehearse")
lprint("your part and learn your lines, sir?")

lprint("I could blow right now!")
lprint("This isn't a goodfella.")

lprint("- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!")
lprint("I think it was awfully nice")
lprint("of that bear to pitch in like that.")
lprint("I think the jury's on our side.")
lprint("Are we doing everything right, legally?")
lprint("I'm a florist.")
lprint("Right. Well, here's to a great team.")
lprint("To a great team!")
lprint("Well, hello.")
lprint("- Ken!")
lprint("- Hello.")
lprint("I didn't think you were coming.")
lprint("No, I was just late.")
lprint("I tried to call, but... the battery.")
lprint("I didn't want all this to go to waste,")
lprint("so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.")
lprint("Oh, that was lucky.")
lprint("There's a little left.")
lprint("I could heat it up.")
lprint("Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.")
lprint("So I hear you're quite a tennis player.")
lprint("I'm not much for the game myself.")
lprint("The ball's a little grabby.")
lprint("That's where I usually sit.")
lprint("Right... there.")
lprint("Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,")
lprint("and he agreed with me that eating with")
lprint("chopsticks isn't really a special skill.")
lprint("You think I don't see what you're doing?")
lprint("I know how hard it is to find")
lprint("the rightjob. We have that in common.")
lprint("Do we?")
lprint("Bees have 1 percent employment,")
lprint("but we do jobs like taking the crud out.")
lprint("That's just what")
lprint("I was thinking about doing.")
lprint("Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor")
lprint("for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.")
lprint("I'm going to drain the old stinger.")
lprint("Yeah, you do that.")
lprint("Look at that.")
lprint("You know, I've just about had it")
lprint("with your little mind games.")
lprint("- What's that?")
lprint("- Italian Vogue.")
lprint("Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.")
lprint("A lot of ads.")
lprint("Remember what Van said, why is")
lprint("your life more valuable than mine?")
lprint("Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!")
lprint("I think something stinks in here!")
lprint("I love the smell of flowers.")
lprint("How do you like the smell of flames?!")
lprint("Not as much.")
lprint("Water bug! Not taking sides!")
lprint("Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!")
lprint("This is pathetic!")
lprint("I've got issues!")
lprint("Well, well, well, a royal flush!")
lprint("- You're bluffing.")
lprint("- Am I?")
lprint("Surf's up, dude!")
lprint("Poo water!")
lprint("That bowl is gnarly.")
lprint("Except for those dirty yellow rings!")
lprint("Kenneth! What are you doing?!")
lprint("You know, I don't even like honey!")
lprint("I don't eat it!")
lprint("We need to talk!")
lprint("He's just a little bee!")
lprint("And he happens to be")
lprint("the nicest bee I've met in a long time!")
lprint("Long time? What are you talking about?!")
lprint("Are there other bugs in your life?")
lprint("No, but there are other things bugging")
lprint("me in life. And you're one of them!")
lprint("Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...")
lprint("My nerves are fried from riding")
lprint("on this emotional roller coaster!")
lprint("Goodbye, Ken.")
lprint("And for your information,")
lprint("I prefer sugar-free, artificial")
lprint("sweeteners made by man!")
lprint("I'm sorry about all that.")
lprint("I know it's got")
lprint("an aftertaste! I like it!")
lprint("I always felt there was some kind")
lprint("of barrier between Ken and me.")
lprint("I couldn't overcome it.")
lprint("Oh, well.")
lprint("Are you OK for the trial?")
lprint("I believe Mr. Montgomery")
lprint("is about out of ideas.")
lprint("We would like to call")
lprint("Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.")
lprint("Good idea! You can really see why he's")
lprint("considered one of the best lawyers...")
lprint("Yeah.")
lprint("Layton, you've")
lprint("gotta weave some magic")
lprint("with this jury,")
lprint("or it's gonna be all over.")
lprint("Don't worry. The only thing I have")
lprint("to do to turn this jury around")
lprint("is to remind them")
lprint("of what they don't like about bees.")
lprint("- You got the tweezers?")
lprint("- Are you allergic?")
lprint("Only to losing, son. Only to losing.")
lprint("Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you")
lprint("what I think we'd all like to know.")
lprint("What exactly is your relationship")
lprint("to that woman?")
lprint("We're friends.")
lprint("- Good friends?")
lprint("- Yes.")
lprint("How good? Do you live together?")
lprint("Wait a minute...")
lprint("Are you her little...")
lprint("...bedbug?")
lprint("I've seen a bee documentary or two.")
lprint("From what I understand,")
lprint("doesn't your queen give birth")
lprint("to all the bee children?")
lprint("- Yeah, but...")
lprint("- So those aren't your real parents!")
lprint("- Oh, Barry...")
lprint("- Yes, they are!")
lprint("Hold me back!")
lprint("You're an illegitimate bee,")
lprint("aren't you, Benson?")
lprint("He's denouncing bees!")
lprint("Don't y'all date your cousins?")
lprint("- Objection!")
lprint("- I'm going to pincushion this guy!")
lprint("Adam, don't! It's what he wants!")
lprint("Oh, I'm hit!!")
lprint("Oh, lordy, I am hit!")
lprint("Order! Order!")
lprint("The venom! The venom")
